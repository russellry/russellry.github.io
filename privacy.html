                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        This Privacy Policy applies to all current and future mobile applications (collectively, the "Apps" or "Services") developed and published by Russell Ong ("I", "me", "my", or "Developer").
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how I collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use my Apps. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. <strong>BY DOWNLOADING, ACCESSING, OR USING MY APPS, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE MY APPS.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. I will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates. Your continued use of the Apps after such changes will constitute your acceptance of the new terms.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Information I Collect</h2>
                    <p>
                        My general philosophy is to collect only the minimum information necessary to provide and improve my Apps. The specific information collected may vary slightly between Apps, but the principles outlined here will apply.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Information You Provide Voluntarily:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> Any data you voluntarily create, input, or store within an App for its core functionality (e.g., notes, tasks, calculations, journal entries, settings). This data is typically stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to me unless a feature explicitly requires it (such as an optional cloud synchronization feature, which would be clearly indicated and require your consent).</li>
                        <li><strong>Support and Feedback:</strong> If you contact me for customer support, to provide feedback, or for other inquiries, I may collect your name, email address, and the content of your communication to effectively address your query.</li>
                        <li><strong>Personally Identifiable Information (for specific features):</strong> For some features or services within an App (e.g., creating an account for premium features, if offered), I may require you to provide certain personally identifiable information. This will be clearly requested and its use explained at the point of collection.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Information Collected Automatically:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        My Apps are designed to minimize automatic data collection. Where data is collected automatically, it is typically for essential operational purposes or to improve the user experience, and is handled as follows:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Device and Usage Data (Non-Personal/Aggregated):</strong> Some Apps may collect non-personally identifiable information about your device (e.g., device model, operating system version) and how you use the App. This may include your device's Internet Protocol (IP) address (which may be anonymized or truncated), the pages or screens of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages/screens, and general usage patterns. This data is typically aggregated and anonymized and may be collected through standard platform services (like Apple App Analytics) or privacy-conscious third-party analytics tools. This helps me understand usage trends and improve the Apps. Any such collection will be for internal purposes only.</li>
                        <li><strong>Crash Reporting:</strong> To maintain and improve app stability, Apps may utilize services (including Apple's own reporting or third-party tools like Firebase Crashlytics or Sentry) to automatically collect diagnostic information when an App crashes. This information (such as device state at the time of crash, OS version, and anonymized stack traces) helps me identify and resolve bugs. This data does not typically contain personally identifiable information.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Precise Location Tracking:</strong> My Applications generally do not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device unless a specific feature requires it and you grant explicit permission.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><em>For specific details on data collection for a particular App, please refer to its App Store listing or any in-app information provided. However, the principles in this policy will always govern.</em></p>

                    <h2>Advertising and Google AdMob</h2>
                    <p>
                        Some of my Apps may display advertisements to support the free versions of the applications. I use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> as my advertising network provider. AdMob is a mobile advertising platform provided by Google LLC. This applies to all of my Apps that show ads (current and future); Apps that are paid or ad-free are excluded from ad collection entirely.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Data Collected for Advertising:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        When you use Apps that display advertisements, Google AdMob may collect certain information to provide and improve ad services. This may include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device identifiers (such as advertising IDs like IDFA on iOS or Advertising ID on Android), device type, operating system, and device settings.</li>
                        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you interact with ads, including ad views, clicks, and interactions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> General location information (approximate location based on IP address) may be used for ad targeting, though precise location is not collected without your explicit permission.</li>
                        <li><strong>App Activity:</strong> Information about the app you're using and general usage patterns to help deliver relevant advertisements.</li>
                        <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Your IP address may be collected and used for ad delivery and fraud prevention purposes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This data is collected and processed by Google AdMob in accordance with Google's privacy practices. Google may use this information to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Show you personalized ads based on your interests</li>
                        <li>Measure ad performance and effectiveness</li>
                        <li>Prevent fraud and abuse</li>
                        <li>Comply with legal obligations</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        For more detailed information about how Google collects and uses data for advertising, please review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google AdMob's privacy information</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Consent and App Tracking Transparency (iOS):</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        On iOS, Apps that use personalized ads will ask for permission to track you across apps and websites (App Tracking Transparency). If you decline, I will request non-personalized ads where available, and ads will still show but will be less tailored. For users in regions that require it (e.g., EU/EEA/UK under GDPR or certain U.S. states under CPRA/CCPA), a consent prompt (Google’s User Messaging Platform) may also be shown before requesting tracking permission.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>How to Opt-Out of Personalized Advertising:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        You have the right to opt-out of personalized advertising. You can control ad personalization through your device settings:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>iOS (tracking permission):</strong> Settings → Privacy &amp; Security → Tracking → disable “Allow Apps to Request to Track” or toggle it off for my Apps.</li>
                        <li><strong>iOS Devices:</strong> Go to Settings → Privacy & Security → Apple Advertising → turn off "Personalized Ads". You can also reset your Advertising Identifier (IDFA) by going to Settings → Privacy & Security → Apple Advertising → "Reset Advertising Identifier".</li>
                        <li><strong>Android Devices:</strong> Go to Settings → Google → Ads → turn on "Opt out of Ads Personalization". You can also reset your Advertising ID by going to Settings → Google → Ads → "Reset advertising ID".</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, you can opt-out of personalized ads from Google AdMob specifically by visiting <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Ad Settings</a> and adjusting your preferences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Note:</strong> Opting out of personalized advertising does not mean you will stop seeing ads. You will still see advertisements, but they may be less relevant to your interests. The number of ads you see will not change.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How I Use Your Information</h2>
                    <p>I use the information I collect (which is minimal and often non-personal) for the following general purposes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To provide, operate, maintain, and enhance the functionality of the Apps.</li>
                        <li>To personalize your experience where appropriate (e.g., remembering your settings locally).</li>
                        <li>To develop new Apps, features, and services.</li>
                        <li>To improve the Apps, including fixing bugs and addressing performance issues (based on anonymized crash reports or aggregated usage data).</li>
                        <li>To respond to your inquiries, support requests, and feedback.</li>
                        <li>To understand and analyze how you use my Services and what products and services are most relevant to users (on an aggregated, non-personal basis).</li>
                        <li>To contact you from time to time with important information, required notices, or marketing promotions related to my Services. You will have the option to opt-out of marketing communications.</li>
                        <li>To comply with legal obligations and protect my legal rights.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Emphasis on Local Data Storage:</strong> A core principle for many of my Apps is to store your primary user-generated content locally on your device. This means I generally do not have access to this data unless you explicitly choose to share it (e.g., via an export function that uses your device's native sharing capabilities or an optional, clearly indicated cloud backup/sync feature).</p>

                    <h2>Sharing of Your Information</h2>
                    <p>I do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share your personal information with third parties for their marketing or advertising purposes, except as described in this policy regarding advertising services.</p>
                    <p>I may disclose information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> I may share your information with third parties if you have given me your explicit consent to do so for a specific purpose.</li>
                        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> I may engage third-party companies or individuals to perform services on my behalf (e.g., analytics providers, crash reporting tools, payment processors for subscriptions like RevenueCat, customer support platforms, advertising networks like Google AdMob). These service providers will only have access to the information necessary to perform these tasks on my behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. I will vet such providers for their privacy and security practices. For example, if an App uses RevenueCat for managing subscriptions, their privacy policy can be found at <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.revenuecat.com/privacy</a>. For advertising services, Google AdMob's privacy policy can be found at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> I may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) comply with a legal obligation or government request; (b) protect and defend my rights or property; (c) prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Services; or (d) protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public.</li>
                        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If I am involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction, as permitted by law and/or contract. I will notify you if your information becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Aggregated or De-identified Data:</strong> Only aggregated, anonymized data may be periodically transmitted to external services to aid me in improving the Application and my service. I may share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you, for various purposes, including research, analysis, or improving my Services.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Data Security</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. I provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information I process and maintain. For example, I limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve my Applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For data stored locally on your device within the Apps, its security is primarily your responsibility and depends on the security measures you implement for your device (e.g., strong passcode, Face ID/Touch ID, keeping your operating system updated).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite these measures, please be aware that no security system is impenetrable, and no method of data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, I cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Data Retention & Opt-Out Rights</h2>
                    <p>
                        I will retain User Provided data for as long as you use the relevant Application and for a reasonable time thereafter, or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. If you'd like me to delete User Provided Data that you have provided via any of my Applications, please contact me at <a href="mailto:russellongdev@gmail.com">russellongdev@gmail.com</a>, and I will respond within a reasonable time, subject to the limitations mentioned above and any app-specific data management processes. Please note that some or all of the User Provided Data may be required in order for the Application to function properly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can stop all collection of information by an Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network. Specific Apps may also offer in-app settings to control certain data collection or features.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Opting Out of Advertising Data Collection:</strong> As described in the "Advertising and Google AdMob" section above, you can opt-out of personalized advertising through your device settings or Google's Ad Settings. However, please note that some data collection may still occur for basic ad delivery and fraud prevention purposes, even when personalized advertising is disabled.
                    </p>


                    <h2>Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
                    <p>Depending on your location and applicable data protection laws (such as GDPR for users in the European Economic Area, CCPA for California residents, etc.), you may have certain rights regarding your personal information. These may include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The right to access, review, update, or request deletion of the personal information I hold about you.</li>

                    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                    <p>
                        I do not use my Applications to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction). My Applications do not address anyone under this age. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If I discover that a child under the relevant age has provided me with personal information, I will take steps to delete such information from my servers or systems immediately. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me at <a href="mailto:russellongdev@gmail.com">russellongdev@gmail.com</a> so that I can take necessary actions.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Apps may contain links to third-party websites, services, or applications (e.g., the App Store, help articles, or integrated third-party functionalities if any are used in specific apps). This Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party services. If you click on a third-party link or use a third-party service, you will be directed to that third party's site or service. I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every third-party service you interact with. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                    <p>
                        This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. I will notify you of any changes to this Privacy Policy by updating the "Last Updated" date on this page. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use of an App is deemed approval of all changes.
                    </p>

While it aims to be comprehensive, specific Apps may have slight variations or additional details provided within their App Store listings or in-app documentation.
